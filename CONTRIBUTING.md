## Advice for new contributors

New contributor and not sure where to start? This section is for you.

Start by setting up a [development environment](/docs/contributing/development.md). This will allow you to run the
project locally and make changes to the code.

Once you have a development environment set up, you can start by looking
at [issue tracker](https://github.com/piscibus/siklid-api/issues). You can find issues
labeled [ðŸ‘‹ Good 1st issue](https://github.com/piscibus/siklid-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%91%8B+Good+1st+Issue%22)
or [ðŸ“– Documentation](https://github.com/piscibus/siklid-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%F0%9F%93%96+Documentation%22+is%3Aopen)
which are good places to start.

Once you have found an issue you would like to work on, fork the repository and start working on it. Once you are
done, submit a pull request. We will review your pull request and provide feedback.

Don't be shy to ask questions. We are happy to help. Don't underestimate your contribution. Even if it is a small we
consider it a big addition to the project. We are happy to have you on board.

If you are facing any problems or have any questions, feel free to reach out to us
on [GH Discussions](https://github.com/piscibus/siklid/discussions).
